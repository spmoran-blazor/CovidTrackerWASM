# CovidTrackerWASM
This is my first Client Side Hosted Blazor application. I decided to use the COVID-19 data available at https://github.com/novelcovid/api as data.

Feel free to use this as you see fit, but as a developer and a teacher, I hope you can find value in this project to bolster your own skills.

Note this project makes use of Blazorize.Bootstrap for a few things.
